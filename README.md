# StockStrategyFinalProject

This project explores four predictive models—LSTM, CNN, ARIMAX, and XGBoost—to forecast AAPL’s next-day closing price using historical data and engineered technical indicators. After evaluating each model on Q1 2025 data using metrics like RMSE, MAE, R-squared, and directional accuracy, XGBoost emerged as the top performer and was chosen for daily retraining to simulate a real trading system. Daily retraining improved the model’s responsiveness to market changes, boosting its performance and making it more effective for short-term swing trading. Future improvements include incorporating external market signals, adjusting feature windows, and experimenting with ensemble strategies for more robust forecasting.
